## Notes from 1/12 meeting

- Keep 95% variance PCA and test various models 
- For random forest, experiment with nested cross-validation
- For logistic regression, check logreg_cv in scikit-learn
- Branchoff: create a predictive model for identifying potentially causative mutations after genetic disease panel
- Idea: hiearchical classification (phenotypes exist on a hierarchy)
